### Hey there 👋

Thanks for visiting!

### Some quick facts about me:

I've spent most of my professional career managing import-export and international logistics related activities with a different degree of responsbility since I got started quite a long time ago. Time flies! 
Besides international trade, I managed the usual paperwork and bureaucracy Spanish small and medium-sized companies deal with. 
I've run my own businesses, being a contractor for around five years, before Brexit, Covid and keeping all the eggs in the same basket kicked me out. 

As I built my first website using Dreamweaver MX back in 2003, I thought it would nice to give it a second taste and more professionally this time. I built a corporate site in 2003, maintained it for a couple of years, and then focused on international trade. 
I love business, speaking different languages on a daily basis, helping customers, dealing with suppliers, but I also love technology, and everything digital and online businesses. 
What I love is how rapidly everything changes. 

🌱 I’m currently learning about: 

- Generative AI 
- No-code tools (Bubble/Webflow/Flutterflow/Supabase) and automation tools.

I upload some small learning projects here.  Although I prefer working with visual programming, I think it is extremelly important to use and understand the foundations of code. 
It may be a bit obsolete, as I used it quite a lot when I was learning the foundations of code.

🗣 Before focusing my efforts on code, I enjoyed learning languages... human languages. As we speak, my skills are as follows:

- Spanish: Native language.
- English: C1+
- French: C1
- Swedish: B2 (Sweden 🇸🇪 is probably one of my favourite travelling destinations in the world)
- Italian: B2


I keep on improving my foreign language skills, but in a more "relaxed way". I enjoy watching movies, and TV shows in any of the languages I can understand.



I've recently joined an aesthetics clinic where I work with websites, creating them from scratch, improving their SEO, running ads, and so on. 
On top of this position, I'm always open for new projects, cooperations and synergies.
