üí¨ Ask me about ... 

It's probably too soon to give a helping hand with code, but I am happy to help with anything related to my previous working experience. 


üó£ Before focusing my efforts on code, I enjoyed learning languages... human languages. As we speak, my skills are as follows:

- Spanish: Native language.
- English: C1+
- French: C1
- Swedish: B2 (Sweden üá∏üá™ is probably one of my favourite travelling destinations in the world)
- Italian: B2


I keep on improving my foreign language skills, but in a more "relaxed way". I enjoy watching movies, and TV shows in any of the languages I can understand.


### Where I started from - where I am heading to.

After quite a long working experience in other fields (mainly as an import, export and logistics manager), I decided to switch to digital businesses from traditional, brick-and-mortar companies. Although I enjoyed my positions and going the extra mile, I missed some innovation and digital transformation. I felt everyday was similar to the day before. 

For different reasons, it took a while until I got 100% involved with a native digital brand, that was in its infancy at that moment. I had the outstanding opportunity to build something great with its owner, until Brexit, and some other issues, made the project difficult to sustain.

It took some months to transfer the local little company that supported the main activity, so I decided to take a short break to strengthen my skills in other areas. I enjoyed technical stuff, while I felt a bit upset about ‚Äúoverexposure‚Äù taught in some social media courses, so I decided to learn more about on-page SEO that could be applied to my basic dev skills.  I enjoy the technical part of digital marking, while I feel unease with overexposure in social media. 

So, I took a few small-sized projects working with solo entrepreneurs, helping them to implement or run their online stores. I worked with CMS such as WordPress/WooCommerce, and Shopify. 

### **March 2020** üò∑

We had a strict lockdown for months that caught me between jobs. 
I created my first (corporative) site in 2003 or so, using Dreamweaver. A static site, a site that served as as a catalogue, to show our latest products and capture leads through a basic form before the users could download a full PDF catalogue. I was in international trade.
I'm pretty sure I was the only applicant who had a site to show her CV at that time.

After a long, long break after my first corporative site in 2003, I thought it was time to focus on code, once and for all.
As a self-taught person who had learnt some human languages on her own, I thought I could do the same with code. Moreover, considering all the available stuff on the internet.

Surprisingly, code lead me to an awesome new world I wasn't aware about: no-code, low-code apps.  I quickly felt for Bubble.io, and Platzi gave me the opportunity to participate in one of the bootcamps the tool arranged.   Then, I invested some resources on a Professional training that helped me to broaden my horizons and learn some advanced concepts in depth. 

### **Present time**

After completing my first no-code related job opportunity, I'm looking forward to joining a new challenge. 

I know code is important, so I keep on learning new concepts everyday (mostly JS and Dart/Flutter).  I love this world, because it allows me to learn something new everyday.  As a very courious person, I feel like fish in water.   

My favourite no-code tools at the moment are: Bubble.io, Webflow and Flutterflow.
