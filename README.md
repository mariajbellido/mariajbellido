💬 Ask me about ... 

It's probably too soon to give a helping hand with code, but I am happy to help with anything related to my previous working experience. 



🗣 Before focusing my efforts on code, I enjoyed learning languages... human languages. As we speak, my skills are as follows:

- Spanish: Native language.
- English: C1+
- French: C1
- Swedish: B2 (Sweden 🇸🇪 is probably one of my favourite travelling destinations in the world)
- Italian: B2


I keep on improving my foreign language skills, but in a more "relaxed way". I enjoy watching movies, and TV shows in any of the languages I can understand.


### Switching careers. Where I started, and where I am heading to.

After quite a long working experience in other fields (mainly as an import, export and logistics manager), I decided to switch to digital businesses from traditional, brick-and-mortar companies.
For different reasons, it took a while until I got 100% involved with a native digital brand, that was in its infancy at that moment. I had the outstanding opportunity to build something great with its owner, until Brexit, and some other factors, made the project difficult to sustain.

It took a while to transfer the local little company that supported the main activity, so I decided to take a short break to strengthen my skills in digital marketing. I enjoyed technical stuff, while I felt a bit upset about “overexposure” in social media taught in some courses.

I took a few small-sized projects working with solo entrepreneurs, helping them to implement or run their online stores. I worked with CMS such as WordPress/WooCommerce, and Shopify.

### **March 2020** 😷

We had a strict lockdown for months that caught me between jobs. 
I created my first (corporative) site in 2003 or so, using Dreamweaver. A static site, a site that served as as a catalogue, to show our latest products and capture leads through a basic form before the users could download a full PDF catalogue. I was in international trade.
I'm pretty sure I was the only applicant who had a site to show her CV at that time.

After a long, long break after my first corporative site in 2003, I thought it was time to focus on code, once and for all.
As a self-taught person who had learnt some human languages on her own, I thought I could do the same with code. Moreover, considering all the available stuff on the internet.

Things have changed a lot since that sites I created in 2003-2004. Anyway, I am pretty excited about everything I learn about everyday. 

And it's also awesome to see that I have many transferable skills to offer to companies thanks to my previous training and professional experience. 

And the best, it's yet to come. I have recently joined a web developer position, and I'm loving it!

*To be continued* 😁
