🗣 Before code, I enjoyed learning languages... human languages.  As we speak, my skills are as follows: 
  - Spanish:  Native language. 
  - English:  C1+  
  - French:   C1   
  - Swedish:  B2 (Probably, one of my favourite travelling destinations in the world) 
  - Italian:  B1+ 

# Switching careers. Where I started, and where I am heading to. 


After quite a long working experience in other fields (mainly import, export and logistics), I decided to switch to digital businesses from traditional, brick-and-mortar companies.  \
For different reasons, it took a while until I got 100% involved with a native digital brand in its infancy.   I had the outstanding opportunity to build something great with its owner, until Brexit, and some other factors, make the project difficult to sustain eventually.

It took a while to transfer the local little company that supported the main activity, so I decided to take a short break to strengthen my skills in digital marketing.   I enjoyed technical stuff, while I felt a bit upset about “overexposure” in social media taught in some courses.  

I took a few small-sized projects working with solo entrepreneurs, helping them to implement or run their online stores.  I worked with CMS such as WordPress/WooCommerce, and Shopify. 

**March 2020** 😷 \
We had a strict lockdown for months that caught me between jobs. \
I created my first (corporative) site in 2003 or so, using Dreamweaver. A static site, working as a catalogue, while I was in international trade.\
I'm pretty sure I was the only applicant who had a site to show her CV at that time.

After a long, long break I thought it was time to focus on code, once and for all. \
As a self-taught person who had learnt some human languages on her own, I thought I could do the same with code.  Moreover, considering all the available stuff on the internet.

And the best, it's yet to come. 

TO BE CONTINUED 😁
