### Hey there 👋

Thanks for visiting!

### Some quick facts about me:

I've spent most of my professional career managing import-export and international logistics activities, with a progressively greater degree of responsibility since I started quite a long time ago. Time flies! 
In addition to international trade, I managed the usual paperwork and bureaucracy that Spanish small and medium-sized companies face. 
I've run my own businesses, as a contractor for around five years, before Brexit and Covid, when keeping all the eggs in the same basket kicked me out. 

As I built my first website using Dreamweaver MX back in 2003, I thought it would be nice to give it a second try and do it more professionally this time. I built a corporate site in 2003, maintained it for a couple of years, and then focused on international trade. 
I love business, speaking different languages on a daily basis, helping customers, dealing with suppliers, but I also love technology, and everything digital and online businesses. 
What I love is how rapidly everything changes. 

🌱 I’m currently learning about: 

- AI
- Automation Tools
- No-code tools

🗣 Before focusing on pivoting to a digital career, I enjoyed learning (human) languages. 
As we speak, my skills are as follows:

- Spanish: Native language.
- English: C1+
- French: C1
- Swedish: B2 (Sweden 🇸🇪 is probably one of my favourite travelling destinations in the world)
- Italian: around B1


And yes, I keep on improving my foreign language skills, but in a more "relaxed way". I enjoy watching movies and TV shows in any language I can understand.

Currently, I build AI systems: Voice AI agents, chatbots and automations.
